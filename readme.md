Hy~'s Visitor Register
==============

**This code is available on Repl.it (https://repl.it/@Hyperfresh/VisitorCode), but it currently isn't working due to some bug on Repl.it!
Please download the project folder (either from Repl.it or from https://github.com/Hyperfresh8080/VisitorCode) and run the code locally on your own machine!**

This is a program for a school task I had to do.
Took a while for me to get done, but hey.
Feel free to look at the code if you want.
